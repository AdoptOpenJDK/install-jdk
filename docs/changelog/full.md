### 1.0.0

_Released 2020 Mar 17_

#### Overview

The initial stable release of `install-jdk`. A GitHub Action to automatically
download and setup JDKs for use in workflows.

This action is based on the [actions/setup-java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java)
action by GitHub which works perfectly fine for simple workflows but does not
scale and lacks configurability.

JDKs are downloaded from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

For usage information please refer to [README.md](/README.md).
