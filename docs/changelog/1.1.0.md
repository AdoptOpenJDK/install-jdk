### 1.1.0

_Not Released Yet_

#### Improvements

- Added `archiveBasePath` and `useArchiveBasePath` input properties which allow
  specifying the archive layout for custom JDK sources.

#### Fixes

- JDK for macOS download from AdoptOpenJDK aren't installed properly. [[GH-3](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/install-jdk/issues/3)]
    - The newly added `archiveBasePath` property defaults to `/Contents/Home/` on
      macOS to support OpenJDK builds from Oracle, and OpenJDK and OpenJ9 builds
      from AdoptOpenJDK out of the box. 
- Made the toolcache aware of the JDK implementation used (`impl` input
  property).
